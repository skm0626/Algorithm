The	80
Little	4
Prince	2
in	169
1943,	1
one	104
year	4
before	10
his	115
death.	3
appears	2
to	449
be	105
simple	3
children’s	1
tale,	2
some	31
would	63
say	16
that	255
it	130
is	288
actually	2
profound	1
deeply	2
moving	1
written	1
riddles	1
laced	1
with	91
philosophy	1
poetic	1
metaphor.	1
Once	3
when	35
I	449
six	8
years	11
old	14
saw	15
magnificent	7
picture	4
book,	1
called	2
True	1
Stories	1
from	69
Nature,	1
about	22
the	875
primeval	2
forest.	1
It	64
of	331
boa	12
constrictor	6
act	2
swallowing	1
an	45
animal.	1
Here	4
copy	1
drawing.	6
In	8
book	3
said:	5
“Boa	1
constrictors	3
swallow	2
their	19
prey	1
whole,	1
without	13
chewing	1
it.	17
After	6
they	70
are	128
not	153
able	12
move,	1
sleep	3
through	9
months	1
need	13
for	109
digestion.”	1
pondered	1
deeply,	2
then,	9
over	23
adventures	1
jungle.	1
And	112
after	6
work	4
coloured	1
pencil	2
succeeded	3
making	6
my	148
first	20
My	10
Drawing	5
Number	5
One.	1
looked	17
like	54
this:	2
showed	3
masterpiece	1
grown-ups,	2
asked	22
them	29
whether	2
drawing	10
frightened	2
them.	11
But	86
answered:	2
“Frighten?	1
Why	2
should	22
any	43

hat?”	1
hat.	1
digesting	1
elephant.	1
since	9
grown-	1
ups	1
were	34
understand	15
it,	5
made	36
another	11
drawing:	2
drew	4
inside	3
constrictor,	1
so	51
grown-ups	8
could	27
see	29
clearly.	1
They	18
always	16
have	138
things	6
explained.	1
Two	3
grown-ups’	1
response,	1
this	71
time,	9
advise	3
me	74
lay	3
aside	1
drawings	2
constrictors,	2
or	32
outside,	1
devote	1
myself	9
instead	1
geography,	2
history,	2
arithmetic	1
grammar.	1
That	13
why,	2
at	93
age	1
six,	1
gave	6
up	22
what	38
might	9
been	32
career	2
as	83
painter.	1
had	79
disheartened	1
failure	1
One	14
Two.	1
Grown-ups	2
never	40
anything	16

tiresome	1

forever	1
explaining	1
So	19
then	23
chose	2
profession,	1
learned	6
